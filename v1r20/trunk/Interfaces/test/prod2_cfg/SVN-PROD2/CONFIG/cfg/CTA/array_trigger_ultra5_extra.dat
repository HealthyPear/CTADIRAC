# Matching to the following telescope definitions:
# 1 - 5: LST, 6 - 59: MST, 60 - 96: DC-SST, 97 - 168: SC-SST, 160: MST/SCT, 170 - 173: LST, 174 - 197: MST/SCT
# Keep in mind: #60 and #169, # 170 at the same place, #3 is less than 40 m away.
# LSTs #1 and #2 are not meant to be used together with #3.
# No implementation foreseen with both DC-SSTs and SC-SSTs in place.
# LST Triggers: (2,3,5); (1,2,4,5,173); (4,5,170,173), (1,2,4,171,172)

# LSTs (+extra LSTs), MSTs, DC-SSTs, extra MSTs (in place of SCTs):
