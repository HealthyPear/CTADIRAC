% This file includes current specifications for a HAMAMATSU R9420 variant
% as the currently favoured PMT candidate for CTA.

% The single-p.e. response, for a collection efficiency of 94% and 
% an afterpulse ratio of 0.02% above 4 (mean) p.e.

% The effect of a 94% collection efficiency is already included in the
% avove single-p.e. spectrum. Only use a value below 1.0 if the actual
% collection efficiency is lower than 94%.
pm_collection_efficiency = 1.0

% The tubes are foreseen to be operated at low gain.
% This has no direct implications on the analog (discriminator) and digitized
% (FADC) amplitudes (which may involve pre-amplifiers) but on the
% effect of TRIGGER_CURRENT_LIMIT together with NIGHTSKY_BACKGROUND.
pm_average_gain = 5e4
% trigger_current_limit = 20.0 % [microAmps] 

% Scaling factor for NSB w.r.t. the the HESS Photonis XP 2960 tubes is
% about 1.42 (depends also on the mirror reflectivity curve).
% Geometric scaling, including mirror area, "shadowing" by masts,
% pixel solid angle, mirror and light cone optical efficiency go separately. 
% nightsky_background = all:0.100 % HESS p.e. per nanosecond (important: "all:" !!)
% Suggested NSB value for LST (f=28 m, 382 m^2 mirror, pixels of 49 mm plus 1 mm gap):
%    nightsky_background = all:0.217 %% 217 MHz NSB p.e. rate
% Suggested NSB value for MST (f=16 m, 104.8 m^2 mirror, pixels of 49 mm plus 1 mm gap):
%    nightsky_background = all:0.171 %% 171 MHz NSB p.e. rate
% Suggested NSB value for SST (f=11.2 m, 37.2 m^2 mirror, pixels of 49 mm plus 1 mm gap):
%    nightsky_background = all:0.128 %% 128 MHz NSB p.e. rate
% All for dark sky regions, off the Galactic plane and at small
% zenith angles. At larger zenith angles the afterglow component of the
% NSB light will be stronger. In the Galactic plane, a factor of two
% brighter is often the case, in some regions even a factor of three.

% The following commented out values are as compiled in:
% pm_gain_index = 5.5   % gain is power-law of voltage
% gain_variation = 0.02 % random gain variation
% pm_voltage_variation = 0.03 % random voltage variation at given gain
% pm_transit_time = 20. % full transit time through tube at nominal voltage
% qe_variation = 0.04   % random QE variation

% The super-bialkali type quantum efficiency curve.
% Note that the specific tube from which this curve was obtained
% had a _HUGE_ afterpulse ratio. Thus this curve has to be verified
% with tubes of an acceptable afterpulse ratio.
% Somewhat less red efficiency would be great.

% Super-bialkali type (high) QE
#define SBA_QE

% The following specification was set up by Razmik but may be wrong
% (it would dominate over shower-intrinsic and intermediate dish spread):
% transit_time_jitter  = 1.3  % PMT single p.e. transit time jitter r.m.s. [ns].
transit_time_jitter = 0.6 %  PMT single p.e. transit time jitter r.m.s. [ns].

% The single-p.e. pulse shape at the discriminator needs to be verified.
% Note that with a 1.3 ns r.m.s. transit time jitter, the multi-p.e.
% pulse shape would be dominated by the transit time jitter.
discriminator_pulse_shape=hess2_comp_shape-v1.dat

% The digitized single-p.e. pulse shape appropriate for GHz sampling
% may have to be replaced for slower sampling.
% fadc_pulse_shape = pulse_CTA.dat
